Problem: Have you ever been in a situation where you just finished a great show and have no idea what to watch next? In today’s vast and rapidly growing entertainment landscape, viewers often struggle to decide what to watch next after finishing a show they enjoyed. With hundreds of platforms and thousands of shows available at the click of a button, the sheer volume of choices can be overwhelming. Traditional recommendation systems often focus on single factors, like genre, leaving out other important elements like the influence of star actors or the vision of directors that shape a show's distinct flavor.
Motivation: Our project aims to address this gap by providing a more holistic recommendation system that not only considers the genre of the show the user has watched but also takes into account the key contributors behind it, such as the actors and directors. By leveraging a multi-dimensional approach to recommendations, we hope to create a system that provides more personalized and meaningful suggestions, helping viewers discover content they are more likely to connect with on a deeper level.
Features: In the case of our program/application, our user would input a show we would know that the “problem” is solved when our application outputs three different lists displaying similar shows via genre, actors, and director/producers.  
Instructons:
1.) Make sure your working directory is the src. folder to accomodate for the relative file path
2.) Select your desired method: MaxHeap or Quicksort
3.) Input a Show
When prompted, input the name of a show, its creator and its genre. The program will process the input and generate three lists:
	•	Similar shows by genre.
	•	Similar shows by directors/producers.
 4.) Data structure comparison
 After displaying the two lists of reccomended shows, the program will also provide you with an execution time for the data structure/algorithm you selected.
